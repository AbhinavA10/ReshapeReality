# ReshapeReality

## To do (Current):

- collision of sprites with edge of visible window
- make it so that when character jumps off walls, he jumps away from walls instead of just up. (Make it like Metroid)
- implement tiled collisions into game
- implement rectWindow into game

## To do (Way Later):
- Discrete collision detection method
- Quadtree / Spatial Partioning
- projectile motion of stakes
