# ReshapeReality

## To do (Current):

- look into git branches
- look into using Tiled with Processing (tiledCollision scratch)
- projectileMouse scratch (to shoot window-lockers)
- collision of sprites with edge of visible window
- make it so that when character jumps off walls, he jumps away from walls instead of just up. (Make it like Metroid)

## To do (Way Later):
- Discrete collision detection method
