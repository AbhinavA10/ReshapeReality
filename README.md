 # ReshapeReality

## To do (Current):
- implement rectWindow into game
	- after locking, the player doesn't recenter correctly after he reaches the edge of the window (possibly?)

## To do (Way Later):
- Discrete collision detection method
- Quadtree / Spatial Partioning
- projectile motion of stakes
- make cutscenes more fluent animations
