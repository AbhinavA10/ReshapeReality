# ReshapeReality

## To do:

- look into git branches
- look into using Tiled with Processing
- Discrete collision detection method
- collision of sprites with edge of visible window
- make it so that when character jumps off walls, he jumps away from walls instead of just up. (Make it like Metroid)
